In the tab, there will be a ready scenario that will allow your company to place links to the latest offers (promotions), leave a number (to be called back), connect to live chat (if an operator is present) or a link to the FAQ.
Optionally, after additional configuration, you will also receive a link from the consultant's consulate portal, where you will be able to handle customer questions via chat, form or even a helpline (after additional configuration).
